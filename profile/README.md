# Community Guidelines

Welcome to the Dev-Spinner! We are a community-driven organization providing well-architectured boilerplates that help startups, individuals, and small to medium businesses (SMBs) kickstart their projects. To ensure a collaborative, respectful, and helpful environment for everyone, we ask all contributors and users to follow these guidelines.

## 1. Be Respectful
Treat everyone with respect. Harassment, abusive behavior, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated. We encourage a positive and constructive environment for everyone, regardless of their experience level, background, or identity.

## 2. Collaboration and Inclusivity
We aim to create an open and inclusive community where all members feel welcome. Contributions are encouraged from individuals of all skill levels. When contributing:
- Be clear and concise in your communication.
- Provide constructive feedback, not personal attacks.
- Help others by sharing knowledge and expertise when you can.

## 3. Open Source Contributions
Our organization thrives on contributions. Whether it's improving an existing project or starting a new boilerplate, we welcome all contributions that align with our goals. To maintain the quality of the projects:
- Follow the guidelines in the **CONTRIBUTING.md** of each repository.
- Ensure your code is well-documented and meets the project’s standards.
- Be mindful of dependencies and ensure they are secure and up to date.

## 4. Use of Boilerplates
The boilerplates provided are meant to serve as a foundation for various types of projects. You are free to use, modify, and build upon them for both personal and commercial projects, provided you comply with the applicable licenses. While using these resources:
- Acknowledge the source and provide proper attribution when required.
- Do not represent modified versions of our boilerplates as the original.
- Respect the licensing terms of all third-party libraries and dependencies included in the boilerplates.

## 5. Reporting Issues and Requesting Features
We welcome bug reports, suggestions, and feature requests. To ensure efficient issue management:
- Use the appropriate issue template provided in each repository.
- Provide as much detail as possible (e.g., steps to reproduce, screenshots, environment).
- Be respectful and patient when making requests or reporting issues. Our maintainers are volunteers dedicating their time to help.

## 6. Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in removal from the project or organization.

## 7. License
All our projects are open-source and licensed under the appropriate open-source licenses specified in each repository. Make sure to review the license before contributing or using the boilerplates.

## 8. Xeospace - Slack Community
We are excited to introduce our Slack channel, **Xeospace**! This is a space for like-minded people to connect, collaborate, and create a healthy co-learning environment. Join Xeospace to:
- Discuss ideas and collaborate with others on open-source projects.
- Seek guidance, share knowledge, and offer support.
- Stay updated with the latest announcements, events, and community activities.
- Engage in casual conversations and network with peers.

**[Join Xeospace](https://join.slack.com/t/xeospace/shared_invite/zt-2rncb2h37-hdBGatm1mPb7ov6AeM3fbQ)** and be part of a vibrant, interactive community!

## 9. Asking for Help
We encourage questions and discussions in our community forums, discussions, or issues (when appropriate). No question is too simple, and the community is here to help. When asking for help:
- Provide a clear description of the issue.
- Share relevant code or logs (avoid sharing sensitive information).
- Be patient, as maintainers and contributors may take time to respond.

## 10. Community Events
We will occasionally host events such as hackathons, meetups, or discussions around our repositories. These events are great opportunities to learn, contribute, and network with others in the community. Stay tuned for announcements in our [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/[YourOrganization]/discussions), on **Xeospace**, or other channels.

## 11. Conclusion
We believe that a strong, respectful community is key to successful collaboration. By adhering to these guidelines, you help us create an environment where innovation and learning can thrive. Let’s build great things together!

Thank you for being part of our community!
